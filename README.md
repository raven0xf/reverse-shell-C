# reverse-shell-C
A reverse shell payload written in C while the server is written in Python. The code is extremely sloppy and unreadable too!
I have been learning C for a week, so I also decided to try Beej's Guide to Networking Programming.

I re-wrote the client example in that book but I also heavily modified it to accept commands.

Please don't bully me.
The code may be terrible, yes, but at least it's 100% clean on virustotal and returns 0 detections.
This is Linux malware, though.

Since C changed my way of thinking and made me re-think my life choices, I asked ChatGPT to write a manifesto for me:

`The advent of the C programming language marked a new era in software development, but with it came unforeseen consequences. Its power and flexibility allowed for rapid and efficient code, but at the cost of readability and maintainability. As programs grew more complex, debugging became a nightmare and even small errors could have catastrophic effects. The focus on performance and low-level control over hardware led to a culture of hackery, where developers would sacrifice good design and safe practices in pursuit of speed. The legacy of C lives on, but its dark side serves as a reminder of the importance of balance and responsibility in software engineering.`
